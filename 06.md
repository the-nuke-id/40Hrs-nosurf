### 16:52

I took another nap. I had nothing to do.

A while after waking up I felt slower and asked myself "Am I stupid?". While talking to  the friend before whom I mentioned in 05.md I remembered having made judgement on the girl. I had told my friend that I thought she was a bad apple. I also added that my opinion of her are my own opinions and are from 5yrs ago. They also may not be reflective of her person now.
<br>But even if I did say I feel awful to have judged her. Why did I judge her? Sure I had been close to her at one point. But why did I see it fit to judge her? I have not talked to her or about her in 5yrs and the moment I did I had nothing good to say? If so, why say anything? Even if there was good to say about her, why say that too? Why say anything? 
<br>I don't know this person. I have no clue how they go about their life. And I have judged them.
<br>This sort of gossipy bad-mouthing is another symptom of this hyper-real internet where consequences seldom exist. And I'm afraid this habit translates to real life too.
<br>Imagine I knew this girl in real life. That I saw her everyday. And I do the same. How awful would that be to face her then knowing that I badmouth this girl that I now am looking at and who is talking to me.
<br>And imagine how absolutely awful would I myself feel imagining people on the internet talking behind my back like this.
<br>These are bad manners. Vulgar habits. Absolutely destructive and bad habits.
<br>I'm no judge. I am not capable of judging no one but my own self. And I judge my own self of poor manners.

I am ashamed of me.
<br>Continually do I find myself facing such opportunities where I can do the right thing and condition myself to instinctively do the right thing but then instinctively do the wrong thing and reinforce the conditioning that had made doing the wrong thing instinct in the first place.
<br>How many more time will I disrupt relations before I learn to be good company? A good, safe, enjoyable company with whom secrets never leak and only the good remains. With whom the harmless bad is understood, forgotten and never judged and the good sticks and forms.

I must teach myself right. Or I am liable to do wrong myself.

In the case of my friend here I should have never judged her but continually maintain my position that I cannot comment on it. I have not talked to the person in 5yrs and do not know her or him or the relationship they have with each other. That was my stand. That was my position. And I allowed the back of head to build up a gossipy syrupy scenario of her being a bad apple. 
<br>I mentioned earlier that I cucked him. Doesn't that make me a rotten apple?

It is 17:04 now.
