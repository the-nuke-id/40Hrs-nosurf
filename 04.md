### 09:52

My day today started at 07:30. Can't say that I had an entirely /nosurf/ day so far cause I did check my Telegram messages, and reddit messages. But the time spent surfing was almost nil. After the itch of checking the messages was satiated I had nothing else to do on the apps.

This isn't entirely ideal but it's very close to that. I probably only spent a combined 5 minutes on it.

This bring me to my next point of interest. That how eerie it is that I feel void without these apps and the environment in them. Its not like what they offer is so marvelous, so enjoyable and pleasurable that I cant resist them. No. It's more like.. they're all I know. They're a habitual part of my day where a chunk of each day for years has been given to them. Without them I feel aimless. Although I do have aims. Plenty of them.

Let me remind myself of me. I am not a wandering, aimless guy. I am mostly a disciplined and dedicated person. Each day I spent working on my studies and diligently do I lift weights for my body. On the surface my habits are good. But my mind is corrupted. My mind houses vices, impulses, temptations not consented by me anymore and I'd like to rid myself of them.

Why do I go around on the internet trolling for a cold silent giddy feeling of laughter? I'm not even funny. What I am is annoying. An annoying force of persistence that is ever-ready to argue for nothing more than a cheap copy of genuine enjoyment.

But it is not me. It is what is me on the internet. And what is me on the internet are my unchained impulses. The internet facilitates such behaviour. Click on the website to go to the hentai that shows vile and shocking stories of "girls" with big eyes and sharp cheeks going through unbelievable scenarios and even more unbelievable orgasms. In that it forces me to catch up to it. A drink of salt water.

But without the internet and without its surf, like the analogy of tea leaves floating on top, does reason and impulse control come back to me. I go outside and see people. I see their bodies, their clothes and read the expression on their face. I listened to the sound they make and judge their expressions and wishes from it. I see how organic they are. How listless, how bored, how.. calm they are. They stand firmly on a little square of ground that their feet can cover and they are comfortable on it. Instinctively do they stand on it and make it their own. They command their own space.
<br>The internet takes away this ability. This ability to be comfortable in the real world where concrete is the foundation not colorful pixels.

But I feel it coming back. This impulse control. And the extremely happy news is that it didn't long for the reversing to begin. I felt its first jolt merely 7hrs after I began. At that time I felt everything getting slower and started finding the idea of catatonic consumption repulsive.
<br>Now after 20hrs I find the light and the shape of things around me making a deeper imprint in the back of my mind. It's not as deep as reality would like but its deeper than it was before.
<br>The inside of my mind feels emptier than it was yesterday. Reason feels to be floating. Its by no means empty but it is emptier.
<br>The hold of video games, TV, Reddit and Telegram seems to be loosening.
<br>The back of my mind is quieter too.
<br>For once, I consider this a very little.. but definite victory.

I wonder what kind of man will I become when I detach myself from this hyper-reality. Spending most of my time alone doing nothing what will I do? Will I brew up old rivalry in my head? Will I play moments where I was betrayed or reviled over and over until I sharpen the anger to a point? Or will I brew some other fanatical emotional - sadness? heroism? protagonist-symdrome? inferiority-complex? anger? victimisation?

Why am I saying all this? Well, it's what Ive seen so many of the people who although not addicted to the internet (like old people for instance) still wouldn't be ideal for a role model. And to say "Oh no.. I'm way too smart to be manipulated into such foolish things!" would just be fanatical too. I am not immune to trickery. Neither of the world, neither of my own emotions, nor of my own mind. The only solace I have is that not all of my mind works against me. The conscious one is on my side. It is the subconscious one that works when I don't think or act is what works against me.

But what is this subconscious mind that I have been calling 'the back of my head' for so long? Is it conditioning? Nurture? Nature? Are these thoughts of my parents? My siblings? Friends? Society? Are they part of that fabric that was alloted to me when I came to exist - like my face, height, body, voice? Or an amalgam of both? 
<br>If it is an amalgam of both then how much of it can I change?
<br>I can change how I look to an extent. I can grow a beard, cut my hair, wear trinkets, wear clothes, get fitter, get thinner, get fatter, speak from my chest, my head or my diaphragm but I can't completely change how I look, at least not without surgery. 
<br>So how much of my mind can I change?
<br>I know how much of my face I CANNOT change. I know underneath the decoration what I look like and will always look like.
<br>But I have no clear answer for the default clay my mind is made of.
<br>I've tried to figure it out. I've tried to feel what thoughts of mine are default. But so far I've not been able to find any thought I cannot change myself.
