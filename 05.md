I talked to a friend over on the internet for about an hour. It was on Telegram. He texted me out of the blue and it seemed he was in trouble. 
<br>He belongs to the class of my internet friends. I know his face and name but have never seen him under the sun.
<br>Around 5yrs ago he invited a girl he had a crush on in the group chat, and due to my impulsive nature and charming writing on the internet I started dating her behind his back.
<br>It all seemed like a forbidden drama at that point. The actors were barely real people to me. The girl I was dating I barely knew except that I frequently received her nudes. And the guy for me was just some guy I knew over the internet. It felt real but in a very plastic way.
<br>But now I feel extremely ashamed of this story. These were real people who knew each other in real life and one of them liked the other dearly. They were family friends who knew each other since childhood and one afternoon when they were 8 the guy slept in the girl's lap under a playground tree and fell in love forever.
<br>And much like a force of nature, a chaos, I served to swoop her from underneath his confidence and behind his back enjoyed her nudes.
<br>It all seems so silly to say out loud too. But I cannot help but look at this in hindsight and feel vulgarly repulsed.
<br>The hyper-real nature of internet has made me unable to empathize with people on it as real complex human beings much like myself. Although I suppose even I don't think of myself as a human on the internet. But still. The impulsive and inconsequential nature of Internet made me live out a pornographic fantasy of typical cuckolding.
<br>I feel just awful to even say it out loud.

But it's now 5yrs later and I've left that group chat and I received a message from him.
<br>Apparently she's blocked him and ignores him. He's become depressive to the point that his father couldn't bear seeing his son like so and decided to phone the girl himself to urge her to talk to the guy. I can only suppose how difficult that must be for him.
<br>And apparently he thought I was the only person he could talk to about this having been at one point his own friend and his crush's boyfriend (although in hindsight I now revile the concept of e-relationships.). 
<br>I was un-cooperative at first, seeing as how its been 5yrs and I'm a changed man now I barely can relate to the situation and the actors involved. But he kept talking and soon I realised how absolutely distraught he was. I couldnt help but momentarily forget my 40hrs /nosurf/ pilgrimage to give him some time of my day to ease his anxiety. I advised him the best I could but in the end, as I've so often found, I probably only served as an momentary entertainment. A wall of text amusing to read but forgotten as soon as its closed.
<br>I feel a bit foolish to even have attempted that. Sure I can tell myself "Oh! SO what if it was useless? At least I tried! And by God if anyone's in peril I'll do it again!" but I've never been selfless like that. I find it useless if I find it useless. And I found it useless.
<br>The guy ended by saying I'm his best friend.
<br>I havent talked to him in years. Im barely the man he knew and he's barely the man I knew.
<br>I'm afraid talking to him would, by conditioning, subconsciously instill in me behaviour of my past terminally-online self and I cannot afford that.
<br>I feel bad. But this is an actor that is addicted to the internet. He's barely real.

It is 13:05 now.
