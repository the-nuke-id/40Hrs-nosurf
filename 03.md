### 21:18

Its time for dinner. And although I'd like to eat it without the aid of some visual media, I am a bit ashamed to write that I lost my composture. I looked at my reddit post. Its got 6 upvotes and 2 comments right now. I haven't read the comments but they're probably "Good luck!". I'd wish the same.

However, I am quite happy to say that after 7hrs of no internet I felt.. change. I started imagining myself stuck constantly consuming stream of hyper-real and hyper-fast information. I looked at myself from afar and thought.. "How?".

I'll be back after dinner.

It is 22:43 now. I spent the last.. 90mins watching Columbo. 
<br>I can only say that the experience was focused. But I'm not there yet. So I cannot allow myself to get back into the machine just yet. Now I'm pretty sad about having put a dent in my 40hrs, but its just a blemish. Just 90mins.

Goodnight.
