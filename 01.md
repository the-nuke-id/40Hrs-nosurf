Around 30mins ago I made a Reddit post on /r/nosurf saying I am going to set a timer for 40hrs and be off the internet for that time. Does 40hrs seem too little? Not to me. A disciplined and tracked 40hrs of no-internet excites me.

Anyway. I am writing here because I'd like to perhaps document some of these thoughts I may be having. There's a good chance even if I crawl to the deadline I may go back to unmonitored internet hours almost immediately and find myself back in the same loop of hyper-reality that has originally warranted this "pilgrimage".

At first, in my head, I was thinking I was doing a service to the /r/nosurf community. That I was maybe "taking one for the team" and mapping out the road 40hrs ahead to go back and tell the folks of. But Just 30mins later I've realised that's probably another symptoms of this hyper-reality living.
<br>When breathing is slowed down and steadied reason allows itself to float on top of the clutter. It's almost buoyant. Almost like when one stops stirring their tea and once settled find any remaining leaves floating on top. In a similar way I've realised that this is of no service to anyone but me. Everyone is so fundamentally different that even if amusing or entertaining it would never be of service to anyone but me. So I keep on writing. For me. For like I said, there's a good chance that even if I crawl to the deadline I may go back to unmonitored internet hours almost immediately. In that instance, I predict this log would be of importance. It'd be accounts of someone I trust and respect. And so, I'm bound to their take word seriously. 

Interestingly, even after I've established that this log is for no one but me I still find myself writing as if I'm being read by a great number of people online. A cunningly hidden grandiose glory in my word of supposed independence. I am sure this is another symptom of this hyper-reality. Look around you. There's no one here. I sit alone here on my desk writing this. I have no inclination to describe vividly my desk. I must not. Breathe. Get back to reality. There's no one here. No one can hear me think. No one can read me write. A deep breath now. Another. Another. Find yourself sitting here all alone and realise reality. True reality. Not just a sub-strata of it which indistinguishably mimics social connection. Real reality. Where to talk you to have to open your mouth. Find yourself noticing time. Let it pass. Slowly. Steadily. Don't rush time. It cannot be rushed. 

I anticipate if I would be slower after 40hrs.

Another interesting thing. I find in the back of my mind flashing imagination. I can see myself seeing the screen I'm looking at while I type this but at the same time between seconds, for microsecond, I see images in my mind. Some are of The Sopranos, some are of Red Dead Redemption 2, some are of Morrowind (I spent 5hrs in the morning today from 5:30am to 10:30am modding it to be modern only to realize I don't like the game anyway.), some are of the internet, some are of random Telegram chats I'm in. 
<br>It's interesting how these images serve as "hooks" to reel me in. They're always like this. A hook of curiousity. A curious harmless question to answer.
<br>What did Tony Soprano feel inside?
<br>What did Columbo feel inside?
<br>What did Arthur Morgan reason?
<br>How dare this Internet "friend" accuse me in the group chat?
<br>Always like these these hooks. Always serving no other purpose than to tangle me.
<br>Almost eerily pornographic in a way. 
<br>Always seeking to over-stimulate my senses in a simulated environment so I lose control of them. If man didn't require sleep I fear this cyclic addiction would have hold of us for years on end. 
<br>Only in sleep is there relief from the hyper-real world.
<br>I imagine they must be laughing. The men who benefit from people like me. Those who have interest in increasing the hours I spend online. 

I imagine they must be laughing at us. And inside their own homes forbidding their own young from its access. And from access to similar vices. Junk food, Porn, Video games, TV. They know better than to let these vices corrupt the minds of their children. They probably encourage them to travel, to read, to have good friends, to make good friends, and whatever else they ask them to do that is in their favours. But what I am sure of is that they laugh at us. That I'm sure of.

Anyway, with all that said I now face a problem. What should I do? How do I spend the time? Just stare at the air? Sit still? Keep writing? 
<br>I had the thought of the playing videogames. Offline. I heard in the back of my head, from the same place where the images flash from, that since it's offline it's technically not online! That would classify it as a /nosurf/ activity, wouldn't it? 
<br>Sure, maybe. But remember when you got Elden Ring and played for 10hrs straight for 10days. Technically you were off the internet. What did you feel? Did after 10days you felt slower? More calm? Detached from the hyper-reality? No. It felt the same as being in hyper-reality. The colours were vivid and bright. The sounds were high definition. It was a simulation and it felt as hyper as the internet does. Videogames may not technically be internet but theyre more close to the internet than to books and walking outside. And with this empirical data we have of Elden Ring's playthrough I have dismissed videogaming as a /nosurf/ activity.

Now I ask myself. What about games like RDR2 with all maps and markers off where there's a huge world to get lost in and use your survival skills to find your way. Or games like Morrowind where there's no map and youre forced to pay attention to what's being said to you for you to find your way?
<br>The back of my head (the same place where the images flash from and counter-arguments stem from) argues that surely this must be good use of the time. It'll teach me important life-skills.
<br>And you know what? I agree. They are great resources to teach yourself life-skills with. I agree. Elden Ring, RDR2, Morrowind can all teach me great life-skills like paying close attention to details, architecture, and using my sense to find my way around these huge open world (in absence of markers and HUD ofc). But not right now. 

If I were healthy and not an addict of the internet, I would be able to use these resources to learn. But as things stand right now where the internet sparks in me a syrupy temptation to be a rabble rouser I'm afraid all the games would do currently is facilitate escapism. That's of no use. And so, all I can say is that it's not the right time. I'll be back to these games one day.

Now, having denied the back of my head another victory it argues "Well what about Columbo! It has these brilliant characters that are obviously real people. And they act cunningly and so Columbo must engage them in a mental game to win. Surely that's good use of your time? It'll teach you how to manage situations."
<br>And again, the back of my head makes a good case that is true. And I do agree with it. I suppose it knows it must make a case that is true on the surface for the hook to work. Like how fishermen put real fishes on the hooks to reel in other live fishes.
<br>Anyway, I agree that watching Columbo (or The Sopranos) is an exercise in game theory. Parties with none to little information having to piece together information all the while making sure the opposition is unalarmed.
<br>And it is true that having watched these shows I have learned great things. I attribute a good amount of my recent personality to The Sopranos, Columbo, and King of the Hill.
<br>And while I do think that they may classify as /nosurf/ I cannot help remember feeling almost catatonic while watching them. Sedentary. Inactive. Just using my eyes to soak in the screen and connect wires with no consent. And there's so much that these connections do. I remember seeing a very attractive lady in an episode of Columbo. Her hair were red and her dress was tight. She had a very attractive body and made equally attractive poses. There's a fair chance that this woman is not alive anymore (the episode aired in the 70s) but seeing her ran electricity through a wire in my head that contained memory of a certain pornographic scene of a woman that looked like the woman in Columbo and sparked in me the temptation to pleasure myself. And so I did. Almost instinctively I drew curtains, drew over my head a sheet, lit brightly my phone screen, tug on the ropes of temptation and control before I loaded up the material to seek pleasure from.
<br>Afterwards, there was no pleasure. It was fearing to realise how these connections worked so quick and instinctively. Was I safe from nothing? Was I tricked? A conventional image of attraction was used in two entirely different places. Both to consume my attention. The man who directed that episode is also probably dead but the tricks he used were used decades later. And I fell for both. 
<br>Would I then be so wrong to say how big of conspiracy is this that I'm part of?
<br>And so. While it is true that these shows would teach me personality traits for me to use in my real life I cannot again benefit from them until I am able to wear out the connections in my head that subliminally connect me to vices unbecoming of my values.

Now, the back of my head, in a very surprising manner, is silent. Is this victory? Hardly. It knows that it doesn't need to convince me. I am an addict. Even if immediate attempt fail it knows all it needs is to wait and soon it'll become unbearable for me to go without my fix of the hyper-real media. If I don't oblige, it knows it can always work itself from another angle. It can show me dreams of these shows, games, or rather my exes, friends in positions I would detest seeing them in and to cope would go about distracting myself with my vices.
<br>The fact that it is quiet means nothing. It knows I'm weak.

Again then, I arrive at the question - What do I do to spend the time? Read? Sure. Why not? I approve of that. But it's so boring, is it not?!? Argh! Well. Tough luck. Cause that's all I can think of right now and I'm too tired to write more. So I can't logically come up an activity. And in the absence of the faculty to reason, I hereby assign for myself the activity of reading.

It is now 15:43.
