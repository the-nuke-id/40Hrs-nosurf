The 40hr /nosurf/ retreat has ended. I woke up today and immediately checked my messages. Guess now the tethers weren't there I saw it fit to jump right back in that hyper-real media.

But I'd like to not make it out so gloomy. I expected to act like this once the 40hrs ended. For one, they're 40hrs not 40days so the change would not be permanent. I fully expected the hold of impulses to still be strong.
<br>But one silver lining is that I feel less compelled to indulge in Reddit comments, Videogames, TV or other hyper-real media. 
<br>I feel it easier to imagine myself just sitting idle. Conserving energy.

I am planning to extend this retreat soon.
<br>Maybe I'll begin tomorrow.

It is 06:05 now.
