### 17:23

It's barely only been 90mins since my last update. In that time I took a nap.

I can feel the withdrawal. The withdrawal isn't so much as physical. It's mostly mental. <br>Since I've denied myself access to hyper-real media I'm instinctively finding something forbidden and pleasurable in it. Although whenever I've used it before I've found it no more than almost pleasurable. I guess it's the nature of man to tug at himself in reverse to what he's decided.

I mentioned in 01.md that the fact my mind was quiet was not indicative of victory because it knew all it had to do was wait for me to feel the boredom unbearable. I am glad I made this prediction because during my nap I had dreams of my "internet friends" and I woke up wanting to find out what were they up to.
<br>Neither do I not really care about who they are and what they are up to, I care so little that were they to die right now I would only use it as a fodder to reinforce the hero-complex of my own psyche that any terminally online internet user feels. A "life is full of ups and downs.. I was there when Anon233 died..". Not a genuine sadness. Just the knowledge of a previously nameless, faceless entity conversing through text having now been turned into mist.

If one of my real friends were to die (God forbid) I would feel genuine loss. A terrible sadness. A heavy feeling that would make me sit on whatever is near at the time to support my weight.
<br>If any of the "internet friends" were to die, all that would happen is a bunch of "Fs in the chats" and gifs.

My point being, I do not genuinely care what they're up to. I just feel troubled at the cut off access.

I need to find comfort in knowing that under these false feelings of "withdrawal" are actually very happy feelings of comfort. If I focus on my emotions, underneath the clutter I can find genuine relaxation. It is after a long time that I have found myself in this position of my own volition. I am not using internet, I am cut off from the internet people, I am not browsing feed, I do not know what's up with my favourite content creator/Video game brand. I have no news of nothing. All I have are imaginations and assumptions in my head but I figure soon they'll dissolve into mist too. It is quiet sublime but definitely a good feeling.

The scary problem is of the unknown. I do not suppose Mr. Lovecraft was talking about not knowing what to do when he said the greatest fear is fear of the unknown but it is scary.. and I do mean scary when I say scary.. that I do not know how to spend my time.
<br>Last time I said I was too tired to logically find the answer to what to do but I feel quiet refreshed and up to the task now so let me figure this out.

Now that I've forbidden myself access to the hyper-real media I find myself not only with time but the slow passage of time in absence of hyper-real media that seems to dissolve weeks in itself. And so here I am tugging the front of my mind finding some pleasurable and passable activity to indulge myself in till the timer rings and 40hrs are done with.
<br>And so I am compelled to ask myself. Why do this? No, not why bear the 40hrs. That is not up for debate. But why be desperate to find an activity? 
<br>If I say I can read the back of my mind says "No its too boring!"
<br>When I say let's go outside the back of my mind says "Oh its too cold, oh I dont have clothes, oh im not groomed, oh its weird, oh i dont wanna go.."
<br>If I say draw the back of my mind says "Oh that's not fun"
<br>If I say make music the back of my mind says "Maybe later"
<br>So its quite clear to me that I am at an impasse with my own mind. Anything I say ultimately results not only in stagnation but discouragement. For why not? In face of a grand time like 38hrs having no activity to distract myself with, isn't that scary? And finding that no activity is found either, isnt that discouraging? The back of my mind sees this as a futile attempt that will sooner or later fail. And if it has to fail anyway.. well.. why don't we just pick.. one teeny tiny.. vice? Just one! A good one! I agreed that games were ultimately resourceful and so were TV.. so.. lets pick that huh? We won't fail that way.

I don't suppose I have to bring to attention the cunningness of the angle the back of my mind employed in trying to reel me in and get its fix of hyper-reality.
<br>But still it was ultimately based in real concern. This basing angles of hooking people in in reality also seems to be a recurring tactic of the back of my mind. The real concern this time being the lack of equally enjoyable things to do.
<br>I'm no masochist. Or a fanatic. If I can avoid pain, I would. I don't believe in the philosophy of sleeping on a floor and I don't believe in the philosophy of 'riding it out'.
<br>So let me actually find what is so exceptionally daunting about nothingness. It's not like I would die if I don't have anything to do these next 38hrs. A fair bit would be spent just sleeping. And what is anyway so wrong with nothing? It can't kill me. It has no physical withdrawal.
<br>The only scary thing about not having things to do is the fact that it's uncomfortable. Empty mind is the devil's workshop and so it invites ill thoughts. Having nothing to do also makes time pass by reaaaaaallyyy slowly. 
<br>But besides that, it's nothing more.
<br>And so I feel I am naturally equipped with dealing with whatever this nothing has to offer. It may be discomforting but besides the occasional pang there's nothing physical to it. 
<br>If anything, I'm actually finding that in this nothing I am naturally gathering my courage and my mind. Thus finding myself less anxious and more in control of my impulses than just 2hrs ago.
<br>How silly it feels. Its only been 2hrs yet feels like 20.
<br>What a weird machine man is.

It is 18:02 now.
